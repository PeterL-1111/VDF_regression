Introduction:

This GitHub repository showcases the results of our volume delay function study, utilizing machine learning and regression modeling techniques. It offers valuable insights into feature importance ranking, accurate numerical prediction, and improved data refinement using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) formula.

Key Highlights:

1. Classification Machine Learning Notebook: Our classification ML model is employed to rank feature importance and make precise predictions, enhancing the understanding of the relationships between various features.

2. Regression Modeling Notebook: Our regression modeling efforts are focused on a segment-based, disaggregated approach using the HCM formula. This resulted in a remarkable 40% increase in overall accuracy. We derived free flow speed and capacity data from trusted sources, incorporating engineer judgment. A non-linear curve was then synthesized, representing the selected criteria and providing an averaged representation of all segments.

3. Excel File Analysis: The accompanying Excel file demonstrates how the regression model reacts to changes in assumption values. This serves as a valuable tool for sensitivity analysis and exploring the model's behavior under different scenarios.
